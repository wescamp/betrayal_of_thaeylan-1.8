    description= _ "Huscarls are the bodyguards of nobles and other such notable figures, and make up the core of the professional army of the Vaeringjar. They are famed for their use of all weapons, but especially the Skeggox.

One aspect of their training is to become equally good with both hands, a skill they make full use of in battle. Most weapon strikes are made for right handed warriors. A left-handed warrior might be able to take some advantage of this, but the Huscarls, with their full knowledge of right handed fighting can really use this as a great advantage. This ploy can only be used when a Huscarl has the initiative, and is easily disrupted by their foe shifting into an aggressive stance."
