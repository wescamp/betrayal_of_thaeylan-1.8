		{MESSAGE_SIMPLE narrator "The kingdom of Thaeylan was forged three generations ago. It united humankind from the coastal plains of the Gladian Sea in the west to the port city of Vaerya in the east. Mighty rivers and towering mountains sheltered the kingdom from the dark hordes of the north and friendly relations with those to its south -- elves and small bands of humans clinging to the outlands -- kept the peace."}
		{MESSAGE_SIMPLE narrator "But the royal succession in Thaeylan was burdened, as great men often are, with poor offspring and the petty squabbles of greedy adjutants. When the third king perished there was no clear successor and the kingdom's rein fell to two fueding cousins, Ayndun and Ryden."}
		{MESSAGE_SIMPLE narrator "Ayndun, the military's Grand Marshal, moved first. He expelled Ryden from the capital and secured the coastal plains. Ryden rode east and from there mounted a resistance, capturing the port city of Vaerya and setting up what has come to be known as the Second Kingdom."}
		{MESSAGE_SIMPLE narrator "The kingdom of Thaeylan began to turn inward. Ayndun and Ryden devoured the kingdom's wealth in a bitter war. New taxes on food and fighting men were levied on the villagers and the countryside turned volatile."}
		{MESSAGE_SIMPLE narrator "King Ayndun's army suffered many losses and his rank of officers dwindled until command of the eastern garrison fell to Muhyrim, a Field Marshal who earned his commission in the hazard of battle, not the elite academies of Alensing. His second-in-command was a pathfinder from the outlands, a man held in suspicion by the king's court but trusted by those few who knew him. Bitter over the war's toll on his people, he held the line for the sake of his men and waited for the day when Ayndun could be opposed openly."}
		{MESSAGE_SIMPLE Ayndun "Muhyrim, you have asked me for reinforcements for many months now, but my troops are already stretched too thin. We have no food to feed our men and we don't have the garrisons needed to keep the countryside quiet. Still, I promised you more troops and today I will deliver."}
		{MESSAGE_SIMPLE Muhyrim "That is great news. These walls are the only thing holding back Ryden's men."}

		{MESSAGE_SIMPLE Muhyrim "Have you gone mad? The river ramparts are the only thing that has held the orcs back all these years! How can you let them into the Thaeylan countryside?"}
		{MESSAGE_SIMPLE Ayndun "We are desperate, Muhyrim. From the field you can't see the strains my kingdom faces! The orcish mind is simple. They want money and as long as we provide it they will follow instructions."}

My name still has a shred of respect amongst the people. You must hurry to the southern crossing and speak to Harold. He can alerto the leaders of the resistance and ride against the orcs from there."}
