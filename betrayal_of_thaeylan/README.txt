1. What is it?
--------------

A two-player campaign for Battle for Wesnoth that will have 12-15 scenarios when complete. Currently there are 9 scenarios complete, which form the first of two major story-arcs.

This scenario is a battle-/army-based campaign similar in some respects to Heir to the Throne. In the beginning, the first player uses predominantly outlaws and the second player uses loyalist units. There are four new units integrated in the campaign in its current state:

Scout 		> *Pathfinder 		> Wayfarer
NONE		> *Field Marshal 	> Lieutenant General 	> Captain General
Mage		> Blue Mage		> Tempest
Scrapper	> Brawler		> Cutthroat

* Leader unit


=========================

2. How to play
--------------

From the main menu of Battle for Wesnoth select Multiplayer. Then browse the list of scenarios on the left and select "Betrayal of Thaeylan". Use all map settings and always load your saved game from this menu.

3. Credits & Thanks
-------------------

Thanks goes first and foremost to the many developers of Battle for Wesnoth, for creating such a malleable game platform. 

All of the scripting is done by me, H-Hour. Most of the spritework for new units is taken either from others or pieced together poorly by me.

Also, the Vaeringjar are included in this distribution but not yet integrated. They will make an appearance in the second part of the campaign.

4. Known Problems
-----------------

- Currently in scenario 6 you are asked to choose from two paths. Only one path is currently complete so either path you choose you will go after the drakes.

- It will load scenario 10 but end immediately. That scenario is not yet done.
